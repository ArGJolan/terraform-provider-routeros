## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `basic` (Set of String) List of basic rates. Client will connect to AP only if it supports all basic rates announced by the AP. AP will establish WDS link only if it supports all basic rates of the other AP.
- `comment` (String)
- `ht_basic_mcs` (Set of String) Modulation and Coding Schemes that every connecting client must support. Refer to 802.11n for MCS specification.
- `ht_supported_mcs` (Set of String) Modulation and Coding Schemes that this device advertises as supported. Refer to 802.11n for MCS specification.
- `supported` (Set of String) List of supported rates. Two devices will communicate only using rates that are supported by both devices.
- `vht_basic_mcs` (String) Modulation and Coding Schemes that every connecting client must support. Refer to 802.11ac for MCS specification. You can set MCS interval for each of Spatial Stream none - will not use selected Spatial Stream MCS 0-7 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-7 MCS 0-8 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-8 MCS 0-9 - client must support MCS-0 to MCS-9
- `vht_supported_mcs` (String) Modulation and Coding Schemes that this device advertises as supported. Refer to 802.11ac for MCS specification. You can set MCS interval for each of Spatial Stream none - will not use selected Spatial Stream MCS 0-7 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-7 MCS 0-8 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-8 MCS 0-9 - devices will advertise as supported MCS-0 to MCS-9

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# Import with the name of the CAPsMAN rates configuration in case of the example use test-rates-config
terraform import routeros_capsman_rates.test_rates test-rates-config
```
