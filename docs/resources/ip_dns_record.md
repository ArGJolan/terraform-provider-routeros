## Schema

### Required

- `address` (String) The A record to be returend from the DNS hostname.

### Optional

- `___id___` (Number) <em>Resource ID type (.id / name). This is an internal service field, setting a value is not required.</em>

- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `name` (String) The name of the DNS hostname to be created.
- `regexp` (String) DNS regexp. Regexp entries are case sensitive, but since DNS requests are not case sensitive, RouterOS converts DNS names to lowercase, you should write regex only with lowercase letters.
